description: Lambda Labs's Jorge Osto's Journey!.
---

This will be an overview of my journey in my first experience with Lambda Labs, I will try to cover all important actions I took individually and all team related actions as well. This is a living document, so if I remember later something new I'll keep adding stuffs here from time to time.

## Planning out our App

When we were approved our Team and assigned the app we wanted to work on, at that point we have discussed a lot about our app is goal. Who is gonna be our audience, what kind of features they will more likely need, etc... so we had a bit of advantage on this. So our main focused was the stack we were using to acomplish this goal. We as team decided that our main goal is to get out of labs with a good portfolio piece where we can showcase our skills to future employers, an this brought to the topic that the best way to do this was by using new technologies that we weren't taught at Lambda School. So this brought the following ideas to the table:

- React or Angular?
- Mobile apps?
- UI Framework
- Node.js and express Backend or Java Backend?
- Relational Database or non-Relational Database?

During this discussion phase i could realize that some team mebers weren't too convinced about all those new stacks, and I could understand their thoughts so even when I was about to try everything new I had to slow down a bit and find some balance between new stacks and known stacks, mainly because they were right about one thing, **This is a tims esensitive project** and if we run into any issues we don't have the expertise to debug the problem as we would have in debugging known issues and if we want to finish a high quality product on time we can't take too many risks. This was the first big lesson to me about working in a team, that my opinion is not the only valueble one and is not the one that matters most, the team will always come first, and this prepared me for the next days.

At the end of this discussion we agreed to split the team in 2 groups, backend and frontend, I ended up in the backend team, mainly because there we will be implementing new stacks and i was eagle to learn and willing to accept the challenge. We decided the stack we will finally be using.

- React: Because the heavy work will be on front end and this will allow us as a team to move faster in order to meet milestones and have some time left to work on some stretch goals that we decided to go for.
- IOS & Android apps: Joseph and I accepted this challenge, because we wanted to learn react-native and because we thought it would be a good way to showcase what we were able to acomplish. We decided to work on this on our own time without affecting our time working with the team in the main app.
- Material UI as the front end components library: This will help us to prototype the app faster and have some goodlooking components following the Material Design idea that Google proposes.
- Node.js & Express Backend & GraphQL: We decided that learning Java in so short timeframe wouldn't be wise, We decided to add GraphQL to the ecuation because we thought it would save us time and add a lot of flexibility, also its a new tech for us that is widely used in the industry.
- non-Relational Database(MongoDB and mongoose): We decided that MongoDB would fit better in the way we wanted to structure our data and will play really well with GraphQL, also it was something that all backend group members wanted to learn so we went for it. We also decided to deploy our back end to AWS.

### Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
[Longe and Parole](http://google.com) and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

### According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

1.  So baboon this
2.  Mounted militant weasel gregariously admonishingly straightly hey
3.  Dear foresaw hungry and much some overhung
4.  Rash opossum less because less some amid besides yikes jeepers frenetic
    impassive fruitlessly shut

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view
back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet
Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric
question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole
and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects
again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using
her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts.

#### Silent delightfully including because before one up barring chameleon

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a
large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and
supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in
which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an
almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the

##### Wherever far wow thus a squirrel raccoon jeez jaguar this from along

She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on
the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a
last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of

###### Slapped cozy a that lightheartedly and far

The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return
to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it
didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk
